NOT WORKING implement 3-coloring
	BUG: Goes into infinite loop on more complex polys (non convex) 
	current implementation is not correct!
modify so that polygon is always a simple polygon
place guards based on coloring
add toggles for triangulation/coloring??
DONE implement triangulation algorithm
